Ingest, process and visualize job listings from 2 websites ([Welcome To The Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/) 
and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)). Job Radar 2.0 offers more possibilities than these websites to filter jobs: 
technologies asked for the role, company statistics from Glassdoor and comparison to other jobs.  
Refactored version of [Job Radar 1.0](https://github.com/FelitaD/job-radar-1.0) with desire to try new technologies:
- _Orchestration_: Airflow &rarr; Prefect
- _Storage_: PostgreSQL &rarr; Snowflake / BigQuery
- _Processing_: Python &rarr; dbt
- _Visualization_: REST API &rarr; Looker Studio / Streamlit
