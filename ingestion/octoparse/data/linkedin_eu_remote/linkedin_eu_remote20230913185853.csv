          ","Production Engineer (Coating Plant)

Help jij ons het maximale uit onze coatinglijn te halen? Wij werken in de stabiele foodmarkt, groeien en hebben plannen voor uitbreiding en professionalisering.

Wat ga je doen?

Als Production Engineer zorg jij voor een effectief en voorspelbaar productieproces. Dit doe je door dagelijks de effectiviteit van ons proces te analyseren en op basis van deze analyses risico’s en uitdagingen in kaart te brengen.

Omdat jij streeft naar een effectief en voorspelbaar productieproces ben jij veel op de werkvloer te vinden. Voor de vijf ploegen ben jij dan ook het eerste aanspreekpunt. Daarnaast heb je ook dagelijks contact met de andere operationele afdelingen om de processen binnen onze plant zo efficiënt als mogelijk te stroomlijnen.

Op basis van de beschikbare data, je eigen inzichten en signalen van collega’s ga jij continu op zoek naar verbetermogelijkheden en werk je aan de optimalisatie van onze processen.

De afdeling bestaat naast de vijf ploegen uit je collega Production Engineer en de Production Manager aan wie je ook rapporteert.

“Op de Coating Plant ben je geen nummer en iedereen kent elkaar. Daardoor kun je snel schakelen. Je maakt het verschil door het doorvoeren van verbeteringen en het oplossen of voorkomen van problemen,

Matthieu Ruijmbeek, Production Engineerr


Wat neem je mee?

Het allerbelangrijkste is dat jij bij onze organisatie past. Je bent praktisch, sociaal en geïnteresseerd in alles wat met techniek te maken heeft. In een omgeving met veel afwisseling en veel lopende projecten kom jij het beste tot je recht. Verder heb jij een technische hbo-opleiding afgerond en ben je analytisch sterk.

Wat krijg je terug?

Salaris tussen de € 3.491 en € 5.242 op basis van 36 uur.
Laptop en telefoon.
25 vakantiedagen, met de mogelijkheid tot het kopen/verkopen van 5 extra verlofdagen.
De mogelijkheid om functie gerelateerde opleidingen en cursussen te volgen.
Flexibele werktijden en de mogelijkheid om incidenteel vanuit huis te werken.


Is je interesse gewekt? Solliciteer dan snel of neem contact op met Wesley Mieras (wesley.mieras@elopak.com) om kennis te maken! Tot en met 31 oktober kun je solliciteren.

Voor meer informatie en vragen over de functie, neem contact op met Frank Morcus (Production Manager) - frank.morcus@elopak.com."
