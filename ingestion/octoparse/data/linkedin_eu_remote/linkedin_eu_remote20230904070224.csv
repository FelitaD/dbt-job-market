          ","Factory software is at the core of value creation, it is crucial to our society because it helps manufacturing companies become more productive, efficient, and environmentally friendly at producing all we need for our daily lives. Due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of factories, building factory software is exceedingly difficult. HappyOps is solving this problem. We strive to build and run powerful data-driven applications that help factories answer questions, reduce waste, and increase performance. In order to do that we build software modules using a variety of cutting edge technologies. Our applications run in multiple factories across Europe and across different industries.




Tasks




We are looking for an experienced software engineer with an academic background and/or professional experience in data science / AI to join our team. You will be responsible for creating value out of data sets we capture from our customer’s factories by harnessing the power of AI.




You will add your own talents and experience to the team: together we will push the envelope and move the boundary of what is considered possible in the space of advanced software systems on the factory shop-floor.




Your responsibilities:




Set up a tech stack / architecture to run ML workloads
Conceptualize and develop first AI use case hypotheses in close collaboration with our customers / domain experts
Validate these hypotheses by implementing, testing and running applications in production
Conduct research on whether GenAI and LLMs can be used to create value in manufacturing processes




Requirements




We seek an outstanding candidate, who is highly driven, smart, confident, and gritty. Our perfect match is hungry to learn and enjoys working in fast-paced environments.

You have experience building and deploying scalable machine learning solutions and data-driven systems
You are familiar with Typescript, Node.js and PosGresSQL
You are a pragmatic engineer. You love challenges and you have a roll-up-your-sleeves and get-stuff-done attitude
You have a strong curiosity and forward-thinking mindset in the field of AI, with an interest in exploring AI technologies into product development.
You have excellent analytical skills, you are diligent, have great attention to detail, and you are able to consistently deliver results under pressure
You value close collaboration with the founder, to shape the product together
You are fluent in English, German is a plus




Benefits




A unique opportunity to revolutionize the manufacturing industry, displace old-school software, and have a tangible impact on the HappyOps success story




A highly relevant technical challenge paired with stimulating use cases from the tangible real world
A world-class multicultural team: we don’t just work together, we truly care about each other and seek to bring out the best in each other every day
If you need more private time to take care of your loved ones then we will try our best to accommodate their needs
A flexible and high-paced work environment, with low hierarchies, competitive compensation, and equity package
We are a remote-first team, so you will have the chance to work from anywhere in Germany, with flexible working hours.




Compensation Range: the compensation range for this role as a base salary is 80,000€ - 110,000€ annually.




Does this sound like you? Then we would love to hear from you! We encourage everyone to apply! In case this role sounds interesting but you don’t think you meet all the qualifications, we will still be happy to hear from you! We are interested to hear about the value you can bring to the role and to HappyOps.




Last but not least, when judging your fit for this position we will not consider your age, gender, sexual identity and/or expression, ethnicity, or religion as these are not relevant to your role within the team."

APPLICATION TEST:

This next step consists of a data entry test.




The goal of this test is: to complete the requested information for some companies, according to several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that you will find in each sustainability report of the correspondent company.




Before you start this process, please, take the time to read the instructions on this e-mail, carefully, so you don’t miss any cues that might help you with the test.




First step: Please open the link below and download all the files:




Second step: Analyze the folder in which you will find an Excel workbook with 2 tabs:




An index, which will contain the description of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you will be required to fill out. You will also find other information that will be useful during your test, such as expected measures of the KPIs (e.g., Millions $), sections of the reports in which you might find the requested info, and keywords to help you in your search.




An Excel spreadsheet that you should complete with the requested information:




In line 3, you will find an example of a company that already has the requested information, in the way that it should be reported.




In lines 5, 6, and 7 you can find the 3 listed companies for which you need to find and insert data.




The columns present the KPIs and respective units in which the information should be entered.




Third step: Verify that you have a total of 4 reports, one for each company listed on the Excel file.




Fourth Step: We suggest you read the index first, and then try to find the already completed information of the company in line 2. If you are able to find all the available information of this company, please proceed to the next step.




Fifth step: Complete the missing information of the companies in lines 5, 6 and 7.




Some important guidelines and instructions to complete this task that you should keep in mind:




Only one value should be reported in each cell (no intervals).




Do not use text to report, unless in KPIs that require it (e.g., Country of the company).




Only use a comma separator for decimal values (you should not use separators for hundreds, millions, etc.).




All values must be reported with 2 decimal cases (if applicable).




No symbols should be used, i.e. if the value to report is 8,94%, only insert 8,94.




If you can’t find information for one of the KPIs, please leave the cell blank.




In some cases, you may need to convert values to the requested units. In these cases, refer to the previous index for clarification on which measure to use and convert accordingly (e.g., Thousands $ to Millions $).




You may need to use excel formulas to calculate some KPIs. In these cases, refer to the previous index for clarification on which calculations you might need to conduct.




We remind you that the goal of this test is to find the right requested KPI information on the reports provided and enter it in the data entry file, for each company.




Please reply to this application attaching the completed Excel file that you received with the following file name format: Data Entry_test_[YOUR NAME]




You’ll receive prompt feedback after we carry out our internal analysis.




At C-MORE, we recognize that our strength and success lie in the collective abilities and diversity of our team.

Bist du leidenschaftlich an IT-Infrastruktur interessiert und freust dich darauf, die strategische Ausrichtung verschiedener Unternehmen zu beeinflussen? Komm in unser dynamisches Team als IT-Berater und nutze deine Expertise, um aussagekräftige Beratungspakete zu erstellen. Unser idealer Kandidat ist eine visionäre Persönlichkeit mit einer starken Beratermentalität, der sich der kontinuierlichen Weiterbildung und Entwicklung verpflichtet fühlt. Diese Position ist perfekt für einen erfahrenen IT-Administrator, der den Schritt in eine strategische Beraterrolle machen möchte.




Aufgaben




Unterstütze uns als erfahrener System Engineer und profitiere von der Vier-Tage-Woche!




Wir suchen dich als Systemintegrator für den Bereich Server & Datacenter mit einem Schwerpunkt auf die Gestaltung und Implementierung von virtualisierter digitaler Infrastruktur (VMware & Microsoft).




Dein Berufsalltag besteht in der Regel aus der Unterstützung unserer Kunden. Dazu hast du einen Arbeitsplatz in unserem Büro, nur ab und zu kann es sein, dass wir dich auch beim Kunden vor Ort brauchen.
Als Engineer unterstützt du unsere Kunden beim Aufbau und dem Betrieb der digitalen Infrastruktur. Neben der Virtualisierungssoftware selbst, gibt es häufig Berührungspunkte mit Systemen aus den Bereichen Firewall, Datensicherung, Netzwerkinfrastruktur und Active Directory.
Deine Erfahrung und Kreativität sind auch bei umfangreichen Restrukturierungen gefragt, wir begrenzen dich nicht in deiner Rolle!
Als Teil unseres Teams findest du selbstverständlich Unterstützung in einem erfahrenen, fachlich brillanten Team, das dich mit offenen Armen empfängt und dich intensiv on the job einarbeitet.




Qualifikation




Das Wichtigste zuerst: Du solltest Freude an IT-Technik haben! Wir meinen damit keine unbezahlten Überstunden, sondern Spaß an der Materie und Lust auf neue Projekte.
Du hast Erfahrung mit Virtualisierungslösungen und kennst den Umgang mit Windows Server ebenfalls. Weiterhin solltest du ein Grundverständnis für die gängigen Netzwerkprotokolle und Dienste (beispielsweise DNS, DHCP, OSI-Layer-Model) mitbringen.
Die Administration von Microsoft 365 ist für dich kein Problem, auch Azure Active Directory ist kein Neuland für dich.
Motivation, Engagement und der Wille, sich aktiv einzubringen und Leistung zu zeigen sind für uns wichtiger als Ausbildungshintergrund oder Studienabschlüsse.
Wenn du Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration bist, Informatik studiert hast oder einen vergleichbaren fachlichen Hintergrund mitbringst, findest du dich bei uns schnell zurecht.
Integrität ist einer unserer wichtigsten Werte, mit denen du dich voll und ganz identifizieren solltest. Unsere Mandanten legen großen Wert darauf und deshalb solltest auch du jederzeit zuverlässig, seriös, freundlich und professionell arbeiten.




Benefits




Du kannst deine Arbeitszeit auf vier Tage verteilen und damit Privatleben und Beruf optimal kombinieren.
Wir sind die Boutique unter den Technologieberatungen – ohne großen Overhead, stattdessen mit echtem partnerschaftlichem Miteinander und rheinischer Frohnatur!
Im Rahmen unseres Karriereplans hast du die Möglichkeit als Partner an unserem Unternehmen beteiligt zu werden und profitierst somit auch langfristig vom Erfolg unseres Teams!
Selbstverständlich bieten wir dir ein attraktives Grundgehalt sowie erfolgsbasierte Bonuszahlungen, die aufgrund fairer, messbarer Ziele vereinbart werden. Ergebnisorientiertes Arbeiten wird in unserem Unternehmen bewusst gelebt.
Dank einer flexiblen Arbeitszeitgestaltung kannst du bei uns Job und Privatleben optimal miteinander verbinden.
Wir treffen uns als Team auch außerhalb der Arbeitszeiten mal auf ein gemeinsames Essen oder einen gemütlichen Cocktail-Abend – allerdings völlig freiwillig und ohne erzwungene Team-Building-Maßnahmen. Auch hier setzen wir darauf, dass jeder Einzelne sich im Rahmen seiner Persönlichkeit ausleben kann und niemand sich zu etwas gedrängt fühlt."

          ","Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.




We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.




This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.




Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.




What you'll do




Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events




Who you are




You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software




About Canonical




Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.




We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

          ","Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.




We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.




This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.




Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.




What you'll do




Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events




Who you are




You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

          ","Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe, APAC and the Americas that simplifies the lives of developers who are making world-changing apps. We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!




We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the Docker Desktop team.




Docker Desktop is one of the core parts of the Docker suite. Every day, several million developers build their own software using our team’s products. Therefore this is an excellent opportunity to work on software for developers like you, with a huge market impact. You should be passionate about how developers’ lives could be made easier, and about Docker’s part in that.




You will work in a cross-functional team whose mission is to make Docker Desktop the fastest, most flexible and most secure way for developers to run containerised workloads. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will use your experience to enable and guide junior engineers in your team, work with the team leaders to agree on priorities, and collaborate on larger projects with your peers in other teams. You will directly work on bug fixing, improvements and feature enhancements of the product.




The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies, as well as to enable others.




Responsibilities:




Design, develop and monitor new features and performance enhancements.
Write, review, maintain, and document code, including unit, integration, and e2e tests.
Collaborate with the leadership team in defining, planning and prioritizing work.
Interact with other teams at Docker and with our users.
Understand customer problems and propose solutions.




Qualifications:




7+ years of experience as a software engineer, preferably using Go.
Knowledge of operating system internals, particularly some or all of networking, file systems and virtualisation.
Systems-level programming experience across Windows, Linux and MacOS.
Experience taking a lead role in the development of a feature.
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.
Proven ability to learn new technologies and languages, and to switch between them as required.
Ability to interact with upstream communities and with our customers in a way that brings credit to Docker.
Experience with Windows Subsystem for Linux, Hyper-V or Windows containers would be an advantage.
Previous experience programming in Go would be an advantage, but not essential.
Experience developing desktop applications would be an advantage, but is not essential.




What to expect in the first 30 days:




You’ll get to meet your team and your assigned ‘buddy’ on day one. Your buddy will be one of your peers, and they will assist you through your onboarding process.
You will also be met with a thorough onboarding plan, that will guide you through all you need to know and set up.
A chance to meet peers across Docker, within several virtual 1 on 1 coffee meetings.
You will be encouraged to start contributing work, by pairing up with a colleague on a work item, and by picking up tasks yourself.




What to expect in the first 90 days:




Feel comfortable in a part of the code base.
Together with your manager, you will set up an individual development plan.
You will be part of decisions that steer the team priorities and influence the quarterly roadmap, by actively participating in team workshops and discussions.
You will have the chance to interact and be visible outside the team, by doing demos of your work to all engineers at Docker, internal tech talks, and meeting and collaborating with customers.




What to expect in the first year:




Have autonomy/ownership over an area of the product.
You will take part in shaping the team vision for the next year.
You’ll have the chance to meet your colleagues face to face in either team, department, or company-wide meetups.
Provide feedback to your peers and manager in our 360 review process.




Perks:




Freedom & flexibility; fit your work around your life
Home office setup; we want you comfortable while you work
16 weeks of paid Parental leave
Technology stipend equivalent to $100 net/month
PTO plan that encourages you to take time to do the things you enjoy
Quarterly, company-wide hackathons
Training stipend for conferences, courses and classes
Equity; we are a growing start-up and want all employees to have a share in the success of the company
Docker Swag
Medical benefits, retirement and holidays vary by country




Docker embraces diversity and equal opportunity. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our company will be.




Due to the remote nature of this role, we are unable to provide visa sponsorship.
