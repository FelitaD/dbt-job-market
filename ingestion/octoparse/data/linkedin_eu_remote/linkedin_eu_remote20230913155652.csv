          ","About Revolut

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of aweso﻿me products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, our super app has helped 30+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth, we believe that two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry, it’s one of the best in the world. And we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force; our engine 🚀 From building a new banking backend to creating an award-winning app, there’s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team can’t do.

Our Technology team isn’t here to fix legacy systems — it’s here to build world-class financial products from the ground up. Products that will be used by millions of people around the world (30+ million people, not that we’re counting) 🌎

We’re looking for Android Developers interested in every step, stage, and release of a feature. Want to work alone? This isn’t for you. We want communicators. One minute you’re chatting to your PO, the next a designer, the next a customer (for feature feedback, we don’t need you on the phones) 📣 Like your projects varied? This is for you. We don’t pigeonhole. We want you to spread your wings and stick your beak into as many places as possible. Fancy it❓

What You’ll Be Doing

Collaborating closely with product designers with a focus on new feature design and prototyping
Assisting in the user experience design process, from wireframes and mockups through implementation and release
Working closely with design and business teams to define and implement elegant solutions to interesting problems
Helping to define and maintain visual guidelines, ensuring consistency throughout the app
Prototyping new user interactions and iterations based on feedback from peers


What You'll Need

A deep understanding of the Android SDK
Experience working on apps which support multiple Android devices
Experience collaborating on software projects with design and backend aspects
To be a quick learner with an ambitious and results-driven personality
Excellent communication and organisational skills
To work well as part of a team in a fast-paced environment
Fluency in English


Nice to have

Insightful opinions about developing for mobile
A GitHub account with some cool projects in it
Experience in financial services
Knowledge/experience working with Hashmaps
Working in TDD approach


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.

Our Culture




It’s pretty hard to condense a culture down to a few words, but we do all have a few things in common.




We’re problem solvers, we’re adaptable, we’re empathy driven and results led.




People here like working in a fast-paced, multi-national, multi-cultural and ever changing environment. Everyone has an impact on a powerful mission, and is happy to roll their sleeves up to ideate solutions and put them in place. Being part of a rapidly growing business means that the answers aren’t always there for us already, but that’s okay; it’s part of the excitement!




If this resonates, we might be the right place for you.




We know that building the future of female health isn’t going to be easy, but we’re hoping you’re up for the challenge.
