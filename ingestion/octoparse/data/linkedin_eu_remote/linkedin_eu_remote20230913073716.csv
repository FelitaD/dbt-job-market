          ","About Revolut

With an arsenal of aweso﻿me products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, our super app has helped 30+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth, we believe that two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture. So far, we have 6000+ people working around the world, from our great offices or remotely, on our mission. And we're looking for more.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry, it’s one of the best in the world. And we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force; our engine 🚀

From building a new banking backend to creating an award-winning app, there’s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team can’t do.

Our Technology team isn’t here to fix legacy systems – it’s here to build world-class financial products from the ground up.

Products that will be used by millions of people around the world 🌎

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated banking systems, but we love the unexpected.

We’re actually better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end 🧠

These geniuses have created our chatbot – the lovely Rita – and they didn’t stop there 🤯

They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality controls in a few weeks. Yes, they’re just that good!

You’ll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, you’ll sit within a Product Team – simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher 🚀

Ready to join? 👇

What You’ll Be Doing

Building APIs making sure they are properly designed and scale according to the business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse - powering reporting, data analytics and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models in order to provide this data to new flows and processes


What You'll Need

5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years Engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in a STEM subject
Fluency in Python, SQL and other OOPLs
Experience with API development & integration
Practical understanding of distributed systems
Ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring and alerting


Nice to have

Experience with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP
Experience with Django Framework


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.

          ","Your opportunity




At New Relic, we provide our customers real-time insights, so they can innovate faster. Our software delivers insightful observability tools across different technologies and distributed systems, enabling software engineering teams to quickly identify, understand, and tackle issues, analyze performance, and get the most out of their software and infrastructure.




We work with data at a scale found at few companies using a diverse tech stack (Go, Java, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Kubernetes, many public cloud web services, and more). You will work with some of the best engineers and seek some of the most complex problems in the industry.




If you love to scale and want to contribute to one of the largest and fastest-growing observability platforms in the market, we want to hear from you. We are a fast-growing software company that cares about our product and culture!




What you'll do




Build, maintain, and scale back-end services and their support tools.
Participate in architectural definitions with a high degree of innovation and creativity.
Creating automation and tooling to make our systems more scalable and easier to deploy.
Working directly within a multidisciplinary team to help our customers and partners.
Research new tools and services to understand complex scenarios and to propose new features.
Working in an agile environment with a DevOps approach—teams build and maintain their own software, including taking turns being on-call.





This role requires




Experience with distributed systems, concurrency, and scaling in a production environment.
Strong experience in writing software in OOP (Java, GO, Python...) and you are not afraid of adapting, learning, and working with different languages and frameworks.
Familiarity with asynchronous programming techniques: streams, event-based flows, task queues, message queues.
Being comfortable in a fast-paced environment focused on delivering production code at a regular cadence using Agile techniques, tools and methodologies.
Having a collaborative work style that includes colleagues in important decisions and leads to shared code ownership.
Proficiency in English.





Bonus points if you have




Contribution to open source projects.
Understanding the value that build and test automation brings to a development team's efficiency and reliability and are passionate about applying these techniques to your projects.
Experience in technical mentorship and support for helping level up the skills of colleagues on the team.





We're looking for bold and passionate people to be a part of our mission to help every engineer do their best work, every day, using data, not opinions, at every stage of the software lifecycle. We'd love to have you apply, even if you don't feel you meet every single requirement. What's most important to us is finding authentic and accountable people who feel connected to our mission and values, not just candidates who check off all the boxes.




We believe in empowering all Relics to achieve professional and business success through a workforce model called Flex First. Flex First allows us to work in a variety of workplaces that best support our success, including fully office-based, fully remote, or hybrid.

          ","Your opportunity




At New Relic, we provide our customers real-time insights, so they can innovate faster. Our software delivers insightful observability tools across different technologies and distributed systems, enabling software engineering teams to quickly identify, understand, and tackle issues, analyze performance, and get the most out of their software and infrastructure.




We work with data at a scale found at few companies using a diverse tech stack (Go, Java, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Kubernetes, many public cloud web services, and more). You will work with some of the best engineers and seek some of the most complex problems in the industry.




If you love to scale and want to contribute to one of the largest and fastest-growing observability platforms in the market, we want to hear from you. We are a fast-growing software company that cares about our product and culture!




What you'll do




Build, maintain, and scale back-end services and their support tools.
Participate in architectural definitions with a high degree of innovation and creativity.
Creating automation and tooling to make our systems more scalable and easier to deploy.
Working directly within a multidisciplinary team to help our customers and partners.
Research new tools and services to understand complex scenarios and to propose new features.
Working in an agile environment with a DevOps approach—teams build and maintain their own software, including taking turns being on-call.





This role requires




Experience with distributed systems, concurrency, and scaling in a production environment.
Strong experience in writing software in OOP (Java, GO, Python...) and you are not afraid of adapting, learning, and working with different languages and frameworks.
Familiarity with asynchronous programming techniques: streams, event-based flows, task queues, message queues.
Being comfortable in a fast-paced environment focused on delivering production code at a regular cadence using Agile techniques, tools and methodologies.
Having a collaborative work style that includes colleagues in important decisions and leads to shared code ownership.
Proficiency in English.





Bonus points if you have




Contribution to open source projects.
Understanding the value that build and test automation brings to a development team's efficiency and reliability and are passionate about applying these techniques to your projects.
Experience in technical mentorship and support for helping level up the skills of colleagues on the team.





We're looking for bold and passionate people to be a part of our mission to help every engineer do their best work, every day, using data, not opinions, at every stage of the software lifecycle. We'd love to have you apply, even if you don't feel you meet every single requirement. What's most important to us is finding authentic and accountable people who feel connected to our mission and values, not just candidates who check off all the boxes.




We believe in empowering all Relics to achieve professional and business success through a workforce model called Flex First. Flex First allows us to work in a variety of workplaces that best support our success, including fully office-based, fully remote, or hybrid.




Read more about Flex First.




New Relic currently has offices in Germany, Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and based on business needs may approve work in Belgium, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, UAE, and other locations throughout the region. Some of our opportunities are limited to specific hiring locations. Talk with your recruiter about your goals and how we can work with you in our Flex First approach!

Qualified applicants may inquire about visa sponsorship. This position is to be filled as soon as possible.




In compliance with applicable law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work and to complete employment eligibility verification. Note: Our stewardship of the data of thousands of customers’ means that a criminal background check is required to join New Relic.
