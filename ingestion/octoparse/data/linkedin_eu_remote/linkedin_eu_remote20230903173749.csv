          ","Wat doet WePublish?

WePublish digitaliseert de reclamefolder markt. De afgelopen 5 jaar is WePublish dé plek voor de grootste retailers van Nederland (bijv. Action, HEMA, Blokker, GAMMA en ICI Paris XL) om hun reclamefolders te digitaliseren. Het gebruik van data uit reclamefolders is uitgegroeid tot een belangrijke bron van inzicht voor folder managers, maar ook promotie managers binnen retail organisaties. Inmiddels vergaard WePublish op grote schaal reclamefolder data. Zowel op de website van retailers als vanuit het eigen consumenten platform Folders.

Door onze slimme techniek die in onze eigen viewer is gebouwd, vergaren we bakken data over de eindgebruiker, weten we precies hoe een gebruiker door een online folder leest en zijn we in staat hier op in te spelen. We verwerven de data uit de online folders die gepubliceerd worden en vertalen dit door naar naar concrete adviezen aan onze klanten. Onze leesgedrag analyses, dashboards en rapporten geven een beeld over het gedrag van de eindgebruiker in de folder van de retailers. Als je wilt werken in een informele organisatie met veel vrijheid, dan passen we bij elkaar. Wij als organisatie willen zo flexibel mogelijk met elkaar omgaan, mits jij op de juiste momenten ook je verantwoordelijkheid pakt. Wij zijn een hecht team met een mooie balans tussen aanpakken en hard werken, en gezelligheid. Daarnaast bieden wij veel doorgroeimogelijkheden of kansen om het data team uit te breiden als klanten steeds meer data willen afnemen.

Wat ga jij als Data engineer bij WePublish precies doen?

Als Data Engineer zal je verantwoordelijk zijn voor het koppelen en ontsluiten van externe databronnen, de opslag van ongestructureerde data binnen het datalake (voor het verzamelen van de data) en interne / externe bronnen combineren. Samen met het team werk je op een Agile wijze en zal je gebruik gaan maken van de nieuwste Microsoft technieken. We zijn onlangs gemigreerd naar het Microsoft Azure cloudplatform, hebben een groot data lake en maken gebruik van Power BI als dashboarding tool. We zoeken iemand die het datalake en dienstverlening samen ontdekt, optimaliseert en nieuwe inzichten weet te vergaren. Dit doe je natuurlijk samen met het team.

Beschik je niet precies over onderstaande kennis maar heb je wel een aantal jaren ervaring als Data Engineer opgedaan, dan komen we ook graag met je in gesprek.

Functie-eisen

Wat vragen we van jou?

Je hebt minimaal HBO+ werk en denkniveau
Zelfstartende en hands-on mentaliteit
Ervaring als Data Engineer
Kennis van datawarehouses / databases (Microsoft SQL, MySQL) , het modelleren van data (Datavault/Kimball), Cloud technieken (Azure)
ETL tooling (bijv. Azure Data Factory)
Ervaring met SQL en NoSQL
Gewerkt met Visualisatie tooling (PowerBI / Tableau / Data Studio).
Wat hebben wij jou te bieden?
Een prima salaris afhankelijk van je werkervaring: Een salaris tussen de €3,781 en €5,633
Werkweek van 32 – 40 uur
Zelf in charge over je werktijden
25 vakantiedagen (mogelijkheid het het extra bijkopen van vakantiedagen, tot max 3 weken)
Je krijgt de vrijheid om met het team mee te denken en je te blijven ontwikkelen. Sterker nog: we denken daarin graag met je mee.
Je mag natuurlijk ook heel graag langs komen op ons kantoor in Oldenzaal. Iedereen is altijd welkom.
Als je op kantoor komt, kan je je uitleven met tafelvoetbal of met een potje poolen.
Na het werk kun je ook samen met je collega’s naar de sportschool (sommige collega’s gaan twee keer per week samen naar de sportschool).

          ","You'll be instrumental in building data ingestion strategies that scale and stay rock-solid. Imagine working with a mix of traditional batch ETL, CDC, and event-based methods – it's going to be thrilling!

Your expertise in infrastructure-as-code, continuous integration, and automated deployment will be a game-changer. We're super thrilled about your ability to ensure top-notch observability.

Guess what? We're all about that DevOps mindset, and we know you'll bring some serious value to our team with your expertise in that area.

Performance is the name of the game, and your database and data warehouse know-how will help us optimize those queries for amazing results.

We're on the lookout for someone who loves tackling challenges head-on, solving those tricky problems, and constantly elevating our analytics platform.

Calling all those with Microsoft Azure skills! If you've got over 3 years of experience with Azure data and analytics services like Synapse Analytics, SQL Managed Instance, Databricks, Event Hub, Data Factory, and Log Analytics – you're exactly who we need!

But that's not all – we're also interested in your experience with container and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and Podman. Plus, if you've worked with orchestration systems like Apache Airflow, that's a major plus in our book!

And hey, we're all about embracing the infrastructure-as-code approach. So if you're well-versed in tools like Terraform, ARM, Cloudformation, or similar, you're someone who should apply.

If this sounds like the perfect fit for you, let's connect! We can't wait to hear more about your impressive experience and see how you'll make a big impact on our team!

          ","Do you agree that the foundation of a future-proof data platform is for your client to be capable of managing the data?




Much can be said about data management, but let's start with data quality, data ownership, and data lineage. Our client believes that you can't deliver honest, usable reports if your data quality isn't up to standard and it's not clear who bears responsibility for it.




Do you find it challenging to work with colleagues from this philosophy to develop a structured (Azure) data platform and build reports based on the customer's needs?




A data engineer stands out with knowledge and/or experience in:




Project Teams:





Willing to work together in small project teams and tackle complex issues in a structured way to come up with future-proof solutions.




Communication:





You naturally have an open approach to communication. You remain receptive, ensuring you ask questions until you fully understand.




Technical:





You are passionate about transforming data into information. You do this based on the latest insights in an Azure environment.




Data modeling is a familiar domain for you. You have an interest and/or experience in both front-end and back-end development of a data platform."

""Our Culture"":




At Capstone, the central principles that we all adhere to, and the glue that holds us together, are our keystones. Our four keystones are:




""A Customer Obsessed, Delivery Focused, Culture""
We're driven to exceed our customer's expectations by listening, leading, solving problems, and delivering what we promise
We aim to be the most dependable and trusted partner serving our customers. TRUST = CONSISTENCY x TIME
""A Culture of Learning and Sharing""
We value ""Lifetime Learners""; those who are hungry, competitive, curious, and self-motivated in their pursuit of knowledge.
Personal and professional growth depends on teamwork and continuous learning. By sharing knowledge, skills, ideas, and effort, we benefit our customers, ourselves, and our communities.
We recognize that the thoughts, feelings, and backgrounds of others are as important as our own. Everyone has something to learn and everyone has something they can teach.
Knowledge and ability are valued. Sharing knowledge and helping others learn new capabilities is valued exponentially.
""A Culture of Growth and Scalability""
Growth comes from not establishing barriers in your role. ""Cross functional skill sets are valued and help us deliver to our customers in a truly agile fashion. It comes with understanding that when asked to do something new, you will need support, have questions, and make some mistakes along the way.
The most elegant solution is a simple solution. Simple doesn't mean easy. It's often more difficult to break a complex problem down into simple, scalable terms. We don't appreciate, or value, over architected solutions or superfluous coding.
Time is one of our most precious commodities. Scalability implies being respectful of this and passionate about making the most efficient use of each and every one of our team members time.
""All Work is Strategic""
No matter how small a project or assignment appears, every single engagement is an opportunity for us to prove ourselves, build trust, and develop relationships that last and grow
Every task, interaction, and commitment matters
Big or small, we execute our plans and strategies with focus, commitment, and passion

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.




If we are able to build tools that meaningfully improve our cooperation and our satisfaction, then we intend to share our insights with the world, both as a narrative and as SAAS or open source that helps other companies follow in our footsteps.




The role of a Workplace Analytics Engineer at Canonical




Support analytics and data mining in a cross-disciplinary team of organisational psychologists, web front end engineers, back end engineers and statistics / analytics experts to help us build a new definition for the 21st century digital workplace. Collaborate to figure out what really drives productivity, effectiveness and happiness in a remote-first globally distributed company.




In addition to your existing people analytics work experience, this role will combine your skills in psychology, data analytics and visualisation, to help create a more effective workplace.




Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges




What we offer you




Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilization. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.




In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. Please note that additional benefits may apply depending on the work location and, for more information on these, you can ask in the later stages of the recruitment process.

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.




If we are able to build tools that meaningfully improve our cooperation and our satisfaction, then we intend to share our insights with the world, both as a narrative and as SAAS or open source that helps other companies follow in our footsteps.




The role of a Workplace Analytics Engineer at Canonical




Support analytics and data mining in a cross-disciplinary team of organisational psychologists, web front end engineers, back end engineers and statistics / analytics experts to help us build a new definition for the 21st century digital workplace. Collaborate to figure out what really drives productivity, effectiveness and happiness in a remote-first globally distributed company.




In addition to your existing people analytics work experience, this role will combine your skills in psychology, data analytics and visualisation, to help create a more effective workplace.




Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges




What we offer you




Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilization. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.

Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations

What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)

Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.




If we are able to build tools that meaningfully improve our cooperation and our satisfaction, then we intend to share our insights with the world, both as a narrative and as SAAS or open source that helps other companies follow in our footsteps.




The role of a Workplace Analytics Engineer at Canonical




Support analytics and data mining in a cross-disciplinary team of organisational psychologists, web front end engineers, back end engineers and statistics / analytics experts to help us build a new definition for the 21st century digital workplace. Collaborate to figure out what really drives productivity, effectiveness and happiness in a remote-first globally distributed company.




In addition to your existing people analytics work experience, this role will combine your skills in psychology, data analytics and visualisation, to help create a more effective workplace.




Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges




What we offer you




Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilization. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.




In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. Please note that additional benefits may apply depending on the work location and, for more information on these, you can ask in the later stages of the recruitment process.

Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.

Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges




What we offer you




Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilization. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.




In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals.

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.




If we are able to build tools that meaningfully improve our cooperation and our satisfaction, then we intend to share our insights with the world, both as a narrative and as SAAS or open source that helps other companies follow in our footsteps.

In addition to your existing people analytics work experience, this role will combine your skills in psychology, data analytics and visualisation, to help create a more effective workplace.




Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.

The role of a Workplace Analytics Engineer at Canonical




Support analytics and data mining in a cross-disciplinary team of organisational psychologists, web front end engineers, back end engineers and statistics / analytics experts to help us build a new definition for the 21st century digital workplace. Collaborate to figure out what really drives productivity, effectiveness and happiness in a remote-first globally distributed company.




In addition to your existing people analytics work experience, this role will combine your skills in psychology, data analytics and visualisation, to help create a more effective workplace.




Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges




What we offer you




Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilization. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.




In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. Please note that additional benefits may apply depending on the work location and, for more information on these, you can ask in the later stages of the recruitment process.

Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills

          ","Bring your people analytics, social science research and data mining/science skills to a unique team seeking to understand, and shape, the future of the digital workplace. We are interested in technology, of course, but we are also interested in the human mission of enabling the world's brightest and hardest working people to live where they want and work from anywhere. Most of our colleagues could move to a tech hub but they choose Canonical because of our mission and our approach to the workplace.




We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this (being remote first for almost 20 years), but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration and organisation.




If we are able to build tools that meaningfully improve our cooperation and our satisfaction, then we intend to share our insights with the world, both as a narrative and as SAAS or open source that helps other companies follow in our footsteps.




The role of a Workplace Analytics Engineer at Canonical




Support analytics and data mining in a cross-disciplinary team of organisational psychologists, web front end engineers, back end engineers and statistics / analytics experts to help us build a new definition for the 21st century digital workplace. Collaborate to figure out what really drives productivity, effectiveness and happiness in a remote-first globally distributed company.




In addition to your existing people analytics work experience, this role will combine your skills in psychology, data analytics and visualisation, to help create a more effective workplace.




Location: This role will be based remotely in the AMER region.




All applicants applying must be legally authorized to work in the United States, as we cannot offer visa sponsorship for this job position.




What your day will look like




Utilize advanced data analytics to understand how we hire and how we work (productivity, happiness and effectiveness) across a global, remote first organisation
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data analytics to find insights and meaningful business outcomes
Tell the story from the insights through dashboards, visualizations and presentations
Design and conduct research into trends shaping talent science and remote work
Collaborate with stakeholder teams (ex., engineering, information systems, etc) to improve the data and tool ecosystem supporting our digital workplace




What we are looking for in you




Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics
Knowledge in advanced statistics, data sciences, coding/scripting languages (Python, R, etc), and databases (SQL, etc)
Strength in data analytics and visualization (Looker Studio, Tableau, etc)
Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges




What we offer you




Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilization. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.




In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals.
