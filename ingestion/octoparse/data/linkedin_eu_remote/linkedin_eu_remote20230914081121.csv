These geniuses have created our chatbot – the lovely Rita – and they didn’t stop there 🤯

They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality controls in a few weeks. Yes, they’re just that good!

You’ll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, you’ll sit within a Product Team – simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher 🚀

Building APIs making sure they are properly designed and scale according to the business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse - powering reporting, data analytics and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models in order to provide this data to new flows and processes


What You'll Need

5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years Engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in a STEM subject
Fluency in Python, SQL and other OOPLs
Experience with API development & integration
Practical understanding of distributed systems

Tasks




Assist the Lead Devops / Full Stack Developer to ideate, design, build, expand, maintain and improve our website(s) and our ReACT platform and its different tools and products. Under each main product, there are various sub- products from the different third parties partners, and relevant payment services.

Requirements




Your bags of tricks




You must prove to us that you:




Have hands-on coding knowledge (from ideation to designing, coding, testing, improving, deploying and maintaining solutions) as well as team leading, engaging and motivating skills.
You know how to work with WordPress and Drupal at minimum, and have knowledge of other programming languages which you will prove to us.
You possess knowledge of UX/UI design: be ready to estonish us!
Databases are your bread: you know how to create, handle, improve, manage them so to ensure that the systems remain agile, lean, secure and resilient to outrages and function endlessly
Consider your work as a Lego brick on top of which we’ll build our future (see modular, scalable, vendor-agnostic, easy interfaceable).
Have excellent skills and will strive to make your work lean (no-value code is a waste), fully explainable, transparent, easy to present, either within your coding (we will always have to be able to proof why algorithms have taken a certain decision) as well as by verbal and written communication skills so to be able to explain complex technical matters in an easy way to non-technical people (grandma, grandpa, kids… Customers and investors…). Solutions will have to be built fully traceable, trackable and according to the man-in the-loop
Needless to say, innovation run, and you continuously and proactively strive not only to stay up-to-date on new tools and features, but dream and work to “ride the wave” and be always upfront in identifying viable and fit-for-purpose solutions for your work and your Company’s strategic targets!
Proof of completion of academy courses and/or study paths on ethic and responsible innovation are highly preferred.
Knowledge and past experiences with Blockchain and DLT related are also extremely valued.





Also:




You can and enjoy translating ideas and strategies into a reality!
You are an extremely curious, passionate, famelic person, always hungry to learn new things, always pushing up the bar of your comfort zone and foolish to think & act WITHOUT the box, like Steve Jobs used to say!
You are creative, understand strategic and high level objectives and translate them into technicalities to create products and services that meet Company’s targets while engaging, exciting Customers!
Yet, as the perfect engineer, you cannot not be fit with strong detailed-oriented and analytical skills to analyze information accurately and make logical, data-driven, risk-based decisions that help in reaching targets while mitigating and / or eliminating the risks.
This also means you must possess strong problem-solving skills and attitude to proactively act to minimize and prevent errors and ability to develop bug-fixing applications to ensure the smooth conduction of tasks.
You are willing to learn or have experience with the Agile/scrum methodologies and possess the aptitude to design, plan, develop, implement, manage and continuously improve your work and projects (lean management, CD/CI mindset)
You must possess and prove excellent (self and team) time management, with the ability to work on multiple tasks to meet the tight deadlines typical of fast-pace Startups, while ensuring proper (quantitative and qualitative) execution of your tasks.
You are able and willing to take real ownership and accountability (and recognition) of your work and get your hands dirty because you own it and you love it!
You are naturally pro-active, able to work and to perform either independently as well as a key team player.
You are a strong believer in and a continuous supporter and advocate of the Sustainable Development Goalsand Ethical and Responsible Innovation. You stay constantly up to date on the “Ethics, Privacy and Security by Design” regulations, directives and recommendations by EU as well as by the most renowned international Authorities, Academies and R&D Entities.
Last, but definitely not least: if you are NOT a strong believer in integrity, honesty, humbleness, values-based attitude… We are NOT looking for you!
You have collected between 2 to 3 years of experience as Full Stack Developer
You have experience on integrating other party’s coding via API’s and fundamental experience on API design and implementation.
You come with knowledge (and passion) about open source, no-code, low-code.
Knowledge of Piwik Pro will be considered as an added advantage.
You come with a strong sense of urgency, constant care and ability to learn fast.
Experience in working on Sustainability related will be a huge plus for your selection.
Your fluency in English is a must and having working knowledge of Italian will be an added advantage: they are the two official languages of our Company!
You come along with a strong desire to learn more about and contribute to the improvement of the Logistics, Supply Chain, Mobility and Transport domains. Furthermore, if you possess basic knowledge of it, you’ll have a great plus for us (although, no worries: reading materials and guidance will also be provided along the job!).
The ability to work following the Europe time zone will be strongly preferred.
You have experience and enjoy (seek for) working remotely, making full use of relevant team and knowing how to set up and work with project management tools.

          ","Production Engineer (Coating Plant)

Help jij ons het maximale uit onze coatinglijn te halen? Wij werken in de stabiele foodmarkt, groeien en hebben plannen voor uitbreiding en professionalisering.

Wat ga je doen?

Als Production Engineer zorg jij voor een effectief en voorspelbaar productieproces. Dit doe je door dagelijks de effectiviteit van ons proces te analyseren en op basis van deze analyses risico’s en uitdagingen in kaart te brengen.

Omdat jij streeft naar een effectief en voorspelbaar productieproces ben jij veel op de werkvloer te vinden. Voor de vijf ploegen ben jij dan ook het eerste aanspreekpunt. Daarnaast heb je ook dagelijks contact met de andere operationele afdelingen om de processen binnen onze plant zo efficiënt als mogelijk te stroomlijnen.

Op basis van de beschikbare data, je eigen inzichten en signalen van collega’s ga jij continu op zoek naar verbetermogelijkheden en werk je aan de optimalisatie van onze processen.

De afdeling bestaat naast de vijf ploegen uit je collega Production Engineer en de Production Manager aan wie je ook rapporteert.

“Op de Coating Plant ben je geen nummer en iedereen kent elkaar. Daardoor kun je snel schakelen. Je maakt het verschil door het doorvoeren van verbeteringen en het oplossen of voorkomen van problemen,

Matthieu Ruijmbeek, Production Engineerr


Wat neem je mee?

Het allerbelangrijkste is dat jij bij onze organisatie past. Je bent praktisch, sociaal en geïnteresseerd in alles wat met techniek te maken heeft. In een omgeving met veel afwisseling en veel lopende projecten kom jij het beste tot je recht. Verder heb jij een technische hbo-opleiding afgerond en ben je analytisch sterk.

Wat krijg je terug?

Salaris tussen de € 3.491 en € 5.242 op basis van 36 uur.
Laptop en telefoon.
25 vakantiedagen, met de mogelijkheid tot het kopen/verkopen van 5 extra verlofdagen.

People here like working in a fast-paced, multi-national, multi-cultural and ever changing environment. Everyone has an impact on a powerful mission, and is happy to roll their sleeves up to ideate solutions and put them in place.
